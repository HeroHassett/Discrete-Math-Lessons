This is a collection of lectures I wrote while teaching a group of students some proof-based prerequisites for an applied real analysis course at New York University (NYU). They cover most of the subjects of a Discrete Mathematics Course plus some extra results in Real Analysis. The textbook that I (very rarely) reference is "Introduction to Real Analysis" 3rd. Edition by Manfred Stoll.
